# Sentiment Analysis on Tweets

This project is inspired and led by ["How to analyze the sentiment of your own Tweets"](https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/topics/tips/2020/how-to-analyze-the-sentiment-of-your-own-tweets) by Jessica Garson!

In this project, we pulls the Tweets from a certain Twitter account from the past 7 days and gives you a score to let you know exactly how his/her week has been.
