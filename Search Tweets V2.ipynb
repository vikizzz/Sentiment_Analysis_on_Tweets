       "50  @megmegmehg Hi Meg, these are two different styles of Snap-T. Our Lightweight Synchilla® Snap-T® Fleece Pullover is heavier than our Micro D® Snap-T® Fleece Pullover making the Lightweight a higher price point. Men's and women's gear that are the same style will always be the same price.\n",
